## Professional Self-Assessment

I started my journey in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University in May of 2018. While completing my degree, I've come to understand many industries and how they all play a part in the computer science realm. From creating applications in multiple programming languages and understanding operating systems and hardware components, to working through the software development life cycle and reverse engineering, I've truly been able to find my passion for this industry.

As a first generation computer science major, I aim to work in the cyber security field as a technical writer, trainer, and professional services engineer. My passion for documentation and deep understanding of this technology shines in my work, and I want to share this knowledge with others. My career goal is direct: to teach others (both internally in my company, as well as customers) on the fundamentals of the product I support, and how that product can improve their application's quality of life. Teaching my customers as well as fellow engineers best practices and to become self-suffcient in protecting their programs is what inspires me in my career path.

## Enhanced Artifact I: Agile Project Charter and SNHU Travel Webinar Application

### Both original and enhanced artifacts can be found in the GitHub Repo [aruhstosnhu/SNHUTravelWebinar](https://github.com/aruhstosnhu/SNHUTravelWebinar)

The artifact I decided to go with for Enhancement One is my “Top 5 Destinations SlideShow” Java application. I also chose to update the application’s project charter. It was originally created in my CS-250 course, Software Development Lifecycle,  in October of 2019. 

### Inclusion

The reason why I chose this artifact is because my enhanced charter will show that I truly understand how to not only create an SDLC program, but also carry it through to completion. I understand these design concepts and can work in a collaborative environment. I also selected this artifact because it had potential for improvement. In my CS-250 course originally, I was not able to successfully add images to my slides and successfully run the application as an executable JAR. The improvements I’ve made in my application show my advancement in my skills and abilities in my software development career.

### Enhancements

- Changed Title of window to be more relevant `setTitle("SNHU Travel Webinar");`
- Edited Text background variable to yellow so it is easier to read `textPane.setBackground(Color.YELLOW);`
- Added 2 additional slides with HTML markdown enhancements (Title and Marketing)
- Added images of actual destinations that display in each individual slide
- Added more in-depth comments within the code to explain the execution of each step in more-detail
- Edited naming of image files used to match the destinations displayed (vs “TestImage”)
- In Marketing slide, added link to Google Sheet that displays pricing chart
- Edited SDLC Charter to include Sales and Marketing team

### Course Objectives

I believe Enhancement One meets the following CS-499 objectives, specifically:

1. **CS-499-01:**
  - *Does the student demonstrate the ability to provide contextual, in-code comments that result in easily readable and understandable code?*   
Yes, my code includes in-depth and improved comments throughout my application that details what each section does.
  - *Does the student demonstrate the ability to support decision making for software design stakeholders?*   
Yes, my improved project charter shows that I understand and incorporate all departments in decision making when creating software.
  - *Does the student demonstrate the ability to discuss experiences and best practices working in collaborative environments?*   
Yes, my improved project charter shows that I am able to discuss best practices when working in an SDLC SCRUM environment with multiple departments.

2. **CS-499-02:**
  - *Does the student demonstrate the ability to communicate appropriately to specific audiences and contexts?*   
Yes, both my improved code and project charter show that I am able to communicate to the targeted audience of the SNHU Travel Slideshow.
  - *Does the student demonstrate the ability to clearly convey his or her ideas and explain his or her thought process through written, visual, or oral communication?*   
Yes, my improved project charter shows that I understand every corner of the SDLC lifecycle, and how to communicate with non-technical departments.

3. **CS-499-04:**
  - *Does the student demonstrate the ability to use the software development life cycle to create realistic production schedules for software projects?*   
Yes, my updated project chart clearly demonstrates that I understand the SDLC production schedules and how to communicate with departments involved in the creation of an application.
  - *Does the student create more robust and efficient code to deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals?*   
Yes, my updated code shows that I am able to create a more advanced slideshow with improved images, improved slides, improved background visuals, as well as the ability to connect to links outside of the application.
