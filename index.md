## Professional Self-Assessment

I started my journey in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University in May of 2018. While completing my degree, I've come to understand many industries and how they all play a part in the computer science realm. From creating applications in multiple programming languages and understanding operating systems and hardware components, to working through the software development life cycle and reverse engineering, I've truly been able to find my passion for this industry.

As a first generation computer science major, I aim to work in the cyber security field as a technical writer, trainer, and professional services engineer. My passion for documentation and deep understanding of this technology shines in my work, and I want to share this knowledge with others. My career goal is direct: to teach others (both internally in my company, as well as customers) on the fundamentals of the product I support, and how that product can improve their application's quality of life. Teaching my customers as well as fellow engineers best practices and to become self-suffcient in protecting their programs is what inspires me in my career path.
